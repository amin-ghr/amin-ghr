## What I Do

I'm that person who's always thinking, "How can data make this better?" As a Data Science enthusiast, I've spent time honing my skills in optimization and machine learning. Whether it's crafting mathematical models or training a model to predict future trends, I'm all in!

## Exploring New Frontiers

When I'm not knee-deep in data, you'll find me sharing my knowledge at an educational institution. I love teaching and helping others grasp the magic of operations research and statistics.

## Let's Collaborate

I believe that the best solutions are born from collaboration. If you're as excited about data's potential as I am, let's chat! Feel free to explore my projects on GitHub and Kaggle.
